# 10-Layer-PCB-Design-for-Portenta-H7-Lite-Breakout-Board

#Introduction

The 10-layer PCB is designed to serve as a breakout board for the Arduino Portenta H7 Lite, ensuring efficient signal integrity and stable high-speed communication. The board integrates impedance matching and differential pair routing to support high-frequency signals used in VR kayaking applications and other performance-critical embedded systems.

#Features

10-layer PCB design for high-speed signal routing and reduced EMI.

Impedance matching techniques implemented for critical signal traces.

High-frequency design considerations to maintain signal integrity.

Breakout board for Potereta H7 Lite with all essential connections.

Optimized power and ground planes for stable operation.

#Design Considerations

Layer Stackup Optimization: A carefully selected layer stack to balance signal integrity and manufacturability.

Controlled Impedance Routing: Ensures minimal signal loss and reflections.

Power and Ground Planes: Strategically placed to reduce noise and improve performance.

Via Optimization: Used to minimize signal distortion and parasitics.
