# 10-Layer-PCB-Design-for-Portenta-H7-Lite-Breakout-Board

Introduction
The 10-layer PCB is designed to serve as a breakout board for the Arduino Portenta H7 Lite, ensuring efficient signal integrity and stable high-speed communication. The board integrates impedance matching and differential pair routing to support high-frequency signals used in VR kayaking applications and other performance-critical embedded systems.

Key Design Features
Impedance Matching

Maintains signal integrity for high-speed data lines like USB, SPI, and BLE communication.
Prevents signal reflections and ensures low-loss transmission across PCB traces.
Differential Pair Routing

Used for USB, high-speed serial, and sensor communication to reduce EMI and crosstalk.
Ensures synchronized transmission by maintaining equal trace lengths and spacing.
10-Layer Stack-Up Optimization

Includes dedicated power and ground planes to enhance signal stability.
Shields sensitive signals and reduces electromagnetic interference.
Component Integration

Supports ICM-20948 IMU sensors, rotary encoders, and external communication modules.
Ensures reliable connection to the ESP32, sensors, and peripherals for accurate data acquisition.
Enhanced Power Distribution

Multi-layer power management minimizes voltage drops and noise coupling.
Optimized for low-power operation and high efficiency.
